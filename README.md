## Accents UI theme

This theme is meant to provide a subtle interface for distraction free coding, with coloured accents (that can be configured). Popular/Useful packages get some attention too, and are adjusted visually to work with the theme!

You can change the accent colour in the theme's settings.  
Some colours that work great:  
>*Crimson*: #d2372b *(default)*  
*Shamrock*: #2ad574  
*Maroon*: #d43167  
*Azure*: #1e91f0  


Feel free to submit issues, or request style changes/additions on github!

Inspired by Brogrammer UI, which I've been a fond user of in Sublime and Atom.
